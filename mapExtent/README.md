#This is a tool to help determine an extent, zoom level, and basemap for constructing a new map.

#The extent can be derived from either the full map or from a bounding box via the "Draw an Extent" button.

## Features

* Written in AMD
* Uses the map "load" and "extent-change" events
* uses version 3.12 of the ArcGIS JS API, but should be able to be upgraded conveniently.

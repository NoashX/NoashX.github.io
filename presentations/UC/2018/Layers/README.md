# Working with Feature Layers, Dynamic Map Services, and OGC in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

Learn how to harness the capabilities of feature layers, map image layers (that consume dynamic map services), and OGC layers using the ArcGIS API 4.x for JavaScript. Version 4.x introduces a new approach for working with these layer types with an improved architecture for simplicity and productivity. This session will include an overview of each of the layer classes, and exploration of their best features through code examples and demonstrations.
